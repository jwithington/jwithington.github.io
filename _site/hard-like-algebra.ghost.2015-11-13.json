Essentially, it's a shorthand way to manage your post formatting as you write!\n\nWriting in Markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where appropriate, you can use *shortcuts* to **style** your content. For example, a list:\n\n* Item number one\n* Item number two\n    * A nested item\n* A final item\n\nor with numbers!\n\n1. Remember to buy some milk\n2. Drink the milk\n3. Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it\n\n### Links\n\nWant to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like http://ghost.org - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's a link to [the Ghost website](http://ghost.org). Neat.\n\n### What about Images?\n\nImages work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this to make it show up:\n\n![The Ghost Logo](https://ghost.org/images/ghost.png)\n\nNot sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing. Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:\n\n![A bowl of bananas]\n\n\n### Quoting\n\nSometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.\n\n> Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.\n\n### Working with Code\n\nGot a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline `<code>` blocks really easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.\n\n    .awesome-thing {\n        display: block;\n        width: 100%;\n    }\n\n### Ready for a Break? \n\nThrow 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider.

The typical path was that fresh/soph/juniors played in Jazz Band II, and Jr./Sr. folks played in Jazz Band I. Music was my thing, though, and my director saw that ever since sixth grade, and so he let me play tenor sax 2 in JB 1. As a freshman. \n\nI was terrified.\n\nBut I did it. It was a small town, and we had a friendly, dynamic, and championship-winning band director. At that time we also had an amazing tenor 1 player who, you know, also played both ways (linebacker and running back, I believe) for the football team that would go to state that year. Band was somehow slightly cool that year--we even had varisty cheerleaders who marched on Saturdays.\n\nI learned a lot playing with that group.

And I remember the night I lost my temper and drove to the game and played the solo of my life.

Expertise, maybe. Desire to teach. Or even just time. It comes back to anxiety about time over and over, but that’s another entry.\n\nMy real dedication to Zen in particular came during another tough job. Two months in to that one I knew I needed to make a change to get through all of the…angst is a word that the nineties ruined but maybe that’s it? All of the stress and pent-up, “oh god this is a lot,” perhaps?  I knew I needed a change and I was in Portland and an internet friend recommended Dharma Rain and off I went. I took an intro class and then I settled in to a routine of attending Wednesday nights; somehow Zen night made a lot more sense than Sunday service did. I loved the dharma talks on Sundays but the discussion classes on Wednesday—and the fact that it was at night—fit me more. \n\nThere were times when I “went to Zen” every single week, and times when there were months (once, maybe even a year) in between visits. Always smiles though, always “we wondered” or just “welcome back,” instead of admonishments or guilt trips that marred the Catholicism of my youth. I mention this a lot whenever I explain my involvement to folks who don’t know about Zen but are curious—the sense of “hey! good to see you!” comes through at Dharma Rain. It motivates folks to return, too, I imagine.  \n\nAfter all, everything is impermanent, we all have our own paths, and sometimes that path takes us in another direction.\n\n***\n\nI’m finding it difficult to read the [moving milestones][mms] without feeling lost. I left Portland in 2011; it was in fall of 2012 when we moved to Macomb with about $100 to spare that I finally stopped contributing my (paltry) $15/month to the center. Dharma Rain, this practice, meditation, thinking about the precepts, working towards mindfulness, not working but just embracing mindfulness...it all makes me a better me.  Place matters to me. We lose this place soon.\n\n***\n\nI don’t talk about Buddhism much; certainly not publicly, not in a way that can be traced to my name and my face and my life. During a beginner's retreat, [the co-abbot][abb] at Dharma Rain asked me about my Catholic family and how they felt about my taking the precepts to become a Buddhist. “I don’t know!” I said, chuckling a bit. “I never told them!”  \n\nThe entire class of people roared at that. For the most part, that lack of knowledge still lingers. I’m 36 now and I couldn’t tell you why it’s still something I can’t bring up with them, but it is.\n\nAnyway, I don’t talk about it much. Part of it is that it is something that feels sacred to me in a world where many of my friends don’t embrace that sort of thing. I spent years in punk rock, too; I had my own break with my upbringing more than 15 years ago, now. I have many more friends that think going to church is odd than friends that go to church. Portland \"gets\" Buddhism more than it gets Christianity, but still it's true that not everyone understands.\n\nI also don’t talk about it much because it is one area of my life where I stay quiet a lot. In the many Wednesday classes I’ve attended, I’ve probably raised my hand to answer something only once, maybe twice.

Expertise, maybe. Desire to teach. Or even just time. It comes back to anxiety about time over and over, but that’s another entry.</p>\n\n<p>My real dedication to Zen in particular came during another tough job. Two months in to that one I knew I needed to make a change to get through all of the…angst is a word that the nineties ruined but maybe that’s it? All of the stress and pent-up, “oh god this is a lot,” perhaps?  I knew I needed a change and I was in Portland and an internet friend recommended Dharma Rain and off I went. I took an intro class and then I settled in to a routine of attending Wednesday nights; somehow Zen night made a lot more sense than Sunday service did. I loved the dharma talks on Sundays but the discussion classes on Wednesday—and the fact that it was at night—fit me more. </p>\n\n<p>There were times when I “went to Zen” every single week, and times when there were months (once, maybe even a year) in between visits. Always smiles though, always “we wondered” or just “welcome back,” instead of admonishments or guilt trips that marred the Catholicism of my youth. I mention this a lot whenever I explain my involvement to folks who don’t know about Zen but are curious—the sense of “hey! good to see you!” comes through at Dharma Rain. It motivates folks to return, too, I imagine.  </p>\n\n<p>After all, everything is impermanent, we all have our own paths, and sometimes that path takes us in another direction.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I’m finding it difficult to read the <a href=\"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/siskiyou-milestones/Moving+Milestones.pdf\">moving milestones</a> without feeling lost. I left Portland in 2011; it was in fall of 2012 when we moved to Macomb with about $100 to spare that I finally stopped contributing my (paltry) $15/month to the center. Dharma Rain, this practice, meditation, thinking about the precepts, working towards mindfulness, not working but just embracing mindfulness...it all makes me a better me.  Place matters to me. We lose this place soon.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I don’t talk about Buddhism much; certainly not publicly, not in a way that can be traced to my name and my face and my life. During a beginner's retreat, <a href=\"http://dharma-rain.org/tag/kyogen/\">the co-abbot</a> at Dharma Rain asked me about my Catholic family and how they felt about my taking the precepts to become a Buddhist. “I don’t know!” I said, chuckling a bit. “I never told them!”  </p>\n\n<p>The entire class of people roared at that. For the most part, that lack of knowledge still lingers. I’m 36 now and I couldn’t tell you why it’s still something I can’t bring up with them, but it is.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I don’t talk about it much. Part of it is that it is something that feels sacred to me in a world where many of my friends don’t embrace that sort of thing. I spent years in punk rock, too; I had my own break with my upbringing more than 15 years ago, now. I have many more friends that think going to church is odd than friends that go to church. Portland \"gets\" Buddhism more than it gets Christianity, but still it's true that not everyone understands.</p>\n\n<p>I also don’t talk about it much because it is one area of my life where I stay quiet a lot. In the many Wednesday classes I’ve attended, I’ve probably raised my hand to answer something only once, maybe twice. I don’t have anyone in my life that I know from the Zen Center that has become a friend outside of the Zen Center.
