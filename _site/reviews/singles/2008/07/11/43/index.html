<article class="post-content">
  <p>You guys, I am seriously in one of those music-devouring phases again (yes  know, hard to believe, but they really are phases, it's not a constant thing) and the devouring has come from two sources, one of them fairly unlikely.</p>
<p>The real source was a <a href="http://soundopinions.net/shownotes/2008/062708/shownotes.html">recent Sound Opinions episode</a>, during which they covered their Best of 2008 (so far).  This kind of thing always charges me up, and I love listening to Kot and Dero because I typically get turned on to a few things that I want to check out (and also vehemently disagree with them on a few things).</p>
<p>Well, this time around, Dero decided to defend the Red Album.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer's_sixth_album">that</a> Red Album.</p>
<p>Weezer seemed to have gone from brilliant to totally gone to exciting to bleh, earning themselves one of <a href="http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/23117-weezer-make-believe">my favorite music reviews of all time</a> in the process. I had given up on them doing anything worth hearing based on second-hand snobbery from that review (and I  will now come clean:  I do actually like that "Beverly Hills Song)(though seriously, "We Are All On Drugs?"  I am pretty sure that Cuomo singing one of his Harvard papers would have been more interesting), and so it was weird to hear Derogatis gushing about Weezer. Prog-rock and Rush-leanings aside, Dero rarely gushes about stuff that isn't worth at least checking out.</p>
<p>He started to talk about a song called "The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)" and I thought, "oh here we go, pretension disguised as fun, please," but then he played it and I was like, "who the hell is this?"  It starts off sounding like a Modest Mouse song and then goes through about four different versions of the song, including an intro that has about 9 different power chords palm muted in a seemingly random way and a Beach Boys style a capella section and...well, as Dero pointed out, this was a band that used to make complicated songs out of disparate parts, and here they were doing it again.</p>
<p>It's fucking great.</p>
<p>Another song that he mentioned is called "Heartsongs," and although that one has one verse too many (the last verse is a bit TOO much), it's an ode to music that they love that will probably inspire another post 'round these parts. Oh, and did I mention that it sticks in your brain? Seriously, I would have to start another twitter feed called "Weezer earworms" for this one.</p>
<p>Is the whole album great? It seems like maybe not, though actually, I don't know. It seems like there are some standouts, definitely, but the thing is, those songs are so great that I haven't really delved into the rest of the album much.</p>
<p>I'm really happy to know that I don't need to write them off any more though.  I always sort of forget about Weezer, but you better believe that nearly every time I spot the Blue Album on a jukebox, I play "In the Garage" or "Surf Wax America."</p>
<p>Enjoy my first nomination for song of the summer.</p>
