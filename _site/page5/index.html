            <p>I feel like a good rule, when I don't know what to do because I am feeling all of the feelings, is to write it out. At the very least, I will have another blog post at the end of it, right? *</p>
<p>I just saw a really <a href="http://www.abbottandwest.com/where-to-eat-farm-to-table-to-coffeeshop-to-brewery-in-portland-or/">great looking</a> article about places to eat in PDX on twitter. I mean, it's got a bit of "I was there first, so I am better" b.s. feel to it, but it also has my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPy_fiv3sAw">favorite ever music venue</a> and my <a href="http://www.voodoodoughnut.com/shop/item.php?item_id=242">favorite ever donut shop</a> so it's not all bad.</p>
<p>And of course  am stupid and when I saw them mention a coffee shopI didn't know about--lilkely because it is new--I googled for it, grabbed the street view, and felt my guts hit my throat because of this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/tumblr_mkyu7lSQcF1qztp42o1_500.jpg" alt="map" /></p>
<h4><a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/d8a8555f3ee52437a936afe944331dfe/tumblr_mkyu7lSQcF1qztp42o1_1280.jpg">click here</a> to embiggen<br />
This is a pretty innocuous photo, really. Right? Just a sunny day, and...a huge line for a donut shop. Okay.</p>
<p>But I cannot tell you how many times I have been on that street, in that place.</p>
<p>It was part of my life before full-time work when I would camp out all day at Stumptown and pay $1 on the counter and skip the line since I was there for drip coffee and sometimes get props from the cute midwestern barista that recognized my <a href="http://www.discogs.com/viewimages?release=1861105">slapstick</a> t-shirts.</p>
<p>After I got the full-time job it was a place I would go during my lunch breaks for donuts for my team or to get an americano for me (and maybe a coworker) in order to help fuel the dark afternoons of playing catch up.</p>
<p>Half a block away I'd wait for the 12 to take me to 57th and Sandy or, later, the 12/19/20 to get me back to 18th and E Burnside.</p>
<p>We had boys and beers at Berbatis, which used to have a music venue entrance where VooDoo is now. And when I left the full-time job behind, I became very acquainted with Johnny Walker Black because of some <a href="http://rotcomic.org/">the best coworkers</a> a man could ask for.</p>
<p>I think maybe this place--not the corner, but the city--might be where I became a man, if that's what I am now, at thirty-five.</p>
<p>It is certainly where I became my own man.</p>
<p>I miss it in my gut the way I used to pine for it--before I moved there--and feel in my bones that I belonged there.</p>
<p>I so did. And I still do.</p>
<hr />
<p>I've been doing the April 30 days stuff! But the results are not all here--they are scattered on <a href="http://pdxrockpoet.tumblr.com">PDX Rock Poet</a> and some other places. Hooray though!</p>
