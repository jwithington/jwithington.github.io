        <p class="post-summary">
          
            <p>Yesterday, <a href="http://PICA.ORG">PICA</a> put out their <a href="http://www.urbanhonking.com/pica/2009/04/pica_2009_time-based_art_festival_lineup.html">schedule for next year</a>, and the thought of another <a href="http://pica.org/tba/">TBA Festival</a> has been bouncing around my head since then.</p>
<p>The first impression I had was that I didn't see any names that I recognized.  I was hoping that they'd bring back <a href="http://mikedaisey.com/bio.sht">Mike Daisey</a>, of course (I did <a href="http://www.urbanhonking.com/pica/2008/09/mike_daisey_monopoly_2.html">call him the darling</a> of the festival last year, and he mentioned trying to do a 24 hour performance--something that I'd love to see), but also, it's pretty unusual that they don't have any repeats.*  When you add the popularity of Superamas and the Reggie Watts fest of last year, I'd have expected at least one of those three artists to be back.  Who knows how busy any of those artists are, but I' recalling the back-to-back years that <a href="http://www.oktheater.org/">Nature Theatre</a> spent here as an example. </p>
<p>There have only been a few performers (most notably, Laurie Anderson) that I have known before hearing about them in conjunction with this festival, and this year continues that pattern. A quick scan of the lineup and I'm already excited about seeing Erik Friedlander (I'm hoping he'll collaborate with the Portland Cello Project at the Works), the Back to Back Theatre piece sounds intriguing, and another piece has...vampires? Pan Pan Theatre's production, looking at living life publicly online, hits home for obvious reasons as well. </p>
<p>At any rate, after stepping up my volunteering for two years, and then becoming a blogger last year, I'm really thinking about taking the week off and getting a (non press) pass this year.  I want to be able to attend the late night stuff as well as the regular shows, and really, I have told multiple people that if I ever move away from Portland, the TBA would keep me visiting annually.  I'd still like to blog, but it also looks like it might be time to take the plunge and grab an audience pass.</p>
<p>*Granted, I'm basing this one what I've seen and remember.  No fact-checking here! There are TBA alums, but none that rang a bell for me.</p>

<p>A while back, one of my friends (can't remember who) told me that they felt I took really great cell phone photos.  Now, one could take that as more of a "wow, this fast food hamburger tastes great!" kind of compliment, but I decided not to do that. </p>
<p>I've been pretty enamored of how the photos have been turning out with my Palm Centro, especially the arrows one from a few days ago.  Mind you, I don't do any digital retouching at all. </p>
<p>I have always been fascinated with making do with the at supplies you have at hand.  When I take  cell phone photo and use it as my artwork for the day, I really did take the photo thinking, "this might be my art for the day."  But digital photos are also so immediate that it always feels like cheating to me.  Especially camera phones.  I don't know why.  I wouldn’t say that Girl Talk cheats by making collages of songs, or that Photoshop artists aren't making art.  </p>
<p>At any rate, it's sleeping time.  Big day at work tomorrow.</p>

<p>I might have already written something about this before, but I'm hoping not.</p>
<p>In the very first week of activities in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1585421464/bookstorenow57-20">The Artist's Way</a>, Cameron implores you to take the bad things that you tell yourself about your creativity and turn them into affirmations.  It's a simple technique--just writing out, say, "I am a bad writer" if you feel that way and then changing it to "I'm an excellent writer," and so on.  This method goes right along with the fact that Cameron sort of frames this process as your "artist's recovery."</p>
<p>Anyway, the weird thing for me was how many of these things came out rather quickly the next time I wrote after reading it.  I began bracketing them with &lt;&gt; in my paper journal and then writing the affirming starements right after them.</p>
<p>Now, I've gotta say, a lot of Cameron's recovery language really feels over the top to me, because I feel more like I am cleaning out the cruft than that I am spiritually exorcising demons of self-doubt.  But while I think of myself as someone who totally supports people as creators--"Dude, if you're writing, you're a writer, PLUS, you're an artist," that sort of thing-- I'm finding, through this exercise, that, as always, I'm better at supporting others than at taking my own supportive advice.</p>
<p>So I'm working on it.  This project has taken up enough of that late night "free time" that I've dropped the daily morning pages and weekly exercises of TAW, to pick them back up in May.  But I will keep thinking about (and discovering how much I limit myself, so that hopefully, I'll stop doing it so much.</p>
