<article class="post-content">
  <p>Harold Ramis <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-02-24/entertainment/chi-harold-ramis-dead-20140224_1_harold-ramis-chicago-actor-second-city">died yesterday</a>, and, well, I&#8217;m not usually one to comment on celebrity deaths, especially not in a blog form. </p>

<p>But the thing about Egon was that he lived in Skokie during the years when I was at Northwestern, and he even sometimes <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/residentialcolleges/documents/article.pdf">came to campus and gave fireside chats</a>.</p>

<p>Now, the caption in that .pdf says that he was at Shepard, and I guess that&#8217;s possible, but I seem to remember him visiting <a href="http://www.northwestern.edu/stuaff/jones/constitution.html">the dorm</a> that I lived in. <a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a></p>

<p>And I also feel like the two people sitting nearest him in that photo are my freshman year girlfriend my freshman year roommate, so there&#8217;s that. I was definitely there! And I am definitely bad at timelines (which at least one of you will point out if, in fact, you were actually there).</p>

<p>I remember him being <strong>so</strong> funny. But also very genuine, and really nice, and real. I might have even asked him a question. That night decided I had missed out on seeing <em>Stripes</em> (still have, though I might watch it now). He signed an autograph for me on a piece of steno paper, and that was that. </p>

<p>These events are lenses into personal history, aren&#8217;t they? I never knew that tonight I&#8217;d be crawling through the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/*">pub.acns.nwu.edu archives</a> to see if I could find my dorm site, or my own site, or <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19990117032625/http://pubweb.acns.nwu.edu/%7Edjf835/jesters.html">the site of the band</a><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981203105651/http://www.drithle.com/jesters/">I used to play in</a>. Heck, I got excited just thinking of &#8220;pub.acns.nwu.edu&#8221; again.<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> </p>

<p>There are traces of us all over the place. There are things to remember, and people to celebrate. Tonight it was Ramis, and a little bit of a <a href="http://et.stok.ca/articles/550-31.html">professor I knew back then, too</a>, yet another accidental discovery.</p>

<p>P.S. Archives, man. <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19991002053629/http://www.nwu.edu/numb/1996/Sections/tenor.html">Archives</a>. </p>
