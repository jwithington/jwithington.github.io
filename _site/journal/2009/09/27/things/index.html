<p>Some things!</p>
<p>--In an attempt to have posts look uniform, I am going to try to have a photo and an eventual read more link in far more of my posts now. Whee!</p>
<p>(can you see how exciting this post's gonna be?)(I bet you can't wait for more!)<br />
<!--more--></p>
<p>--I wrote about 800 words tonight. Not online--SIMPLY TO WRITE! This is astounding to me.</p>
<p>--And scary because I know it's lame to start with my childhood but I'm going with the "just write, sort it later" mentality  It's always worked before, and I believe in it deeply.</p>
<p>--There's actually, perhaps a story in what I was writing. Somewhere anyway. And that's also quite exciting. Because I do believe I will be applying for grad school in writing within a year or so, and uh, that means writing samples, eh?</p>
<p>--I would totally apply this year, to start fall of next, but the lack of samples and current letters of rec would be challenging. As would the GRE-taking and fee-paying.</p>
<p>--I am listening to soma.fm tonight, exciting in and of itself, but also I'm delighted to report that it's over wifi, on my netbook, <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-VLC-Media-Player-to-Listen-to-Internet-Radio">through VLC</a>. Computers are awesome.</p>
<p>--So is <a href="http://jolicloud.com">jolicloud</a>. Seriously, it just works. And for Linux on an Asus EEE PC 900, that's pretty amazing.</p>
<p>--I've taken three sick days in a row, which is something I maybe have done one other time in the 2.5 years I've had a job with that many sick hours. It's crazy. More on that in a second.</p>
<p>--I've never been sure what genre I would want to study for writing, even though I'd like a 3 year program.  Isn't that odd? And now I think maybe even creative non-fiction even though I think terms like that are actually fictional.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>So the being sick thing.</p>
<p>It was really bad. By the second full day off, I essentially was in bed all day, only pausing for more liquids and to pee.</p>
<p>But the main thing it did was slow me down. A lot. Things got very basic (in my head: "okay it's 1pm so you have to eat" or "it's a good idea to drink more of something."), but it also upset me when I got caught up in reading about MA programs so I wanted to write or at least look up specific program info, and I simply didn't have the energy.</p>
<p>I was able to see what scarce ability looked like, and that was a bit game-changing for me.  I feel like this week has taken so long, and in such a good way, despite being sick, because it really just became about setting myself up for successfully getting healthy again.</p>
<p>Weeks can always feel this long, if I just wasn't stuck online all the time, if I was writing, doing the right things, for me.  I see a lot more of that now, and I'm so glad.</p>
<p>I'm excited about a new adventure!  It's starting soon. Maybe even tonight.<em></em></p>
<p><em>I'll edit tomorrow, so apologies for any weirdness. It's time for sleeping!</em></p>
