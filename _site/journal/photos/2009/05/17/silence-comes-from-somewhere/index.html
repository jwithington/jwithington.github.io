<p>Today has been quiet.<br />
<!--more-->
<p>Erin and I stayed up very late after an evening of a lot of drinking and awesome company.  We celebrated one coworker's 25th bday and another's 28th; I drank odd themed martinis and Erin searched for suitable beer. When we came home, I (again) got lost in some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Orion_II">MoO2</a> while she cracked up at Trailer Park boys outtakes.  For the first time maybe ever, I began feeling like it was okay to lose my mind in a game for a while.  I've always had a lot of guilt associated with that sort of thing.</p>
<p>This morning was the second morning in a row when I woke up and my first three tasks were walk Wrigley, meditate, write morning pages. Both times, I could have gotten up simply to walk Wrigs and then go back to bed; both times I consciously went for the meditation/writing route. I'm so glad I did; it felt right.</p>
<p>The last few weeks have been challenging at work, but I met a pretty large personal goal on Friday and I feel like everything felt lighter as a result.  It bled into the weekend, and the way that this weekend feels so long, so full of life and love and friends really seems to have happened as a result.</p>
<p>For a long time, I stopped thinking of myself as "stressed."  Perhaps overbusy, overworked, juggling, but not stressed.  I picture the molting of a shell after Friday, though, and consider how much stress I had been feeling.  As I grow older I realize I have a very weird mix of perfectionism with a belief in wanting to be allowed to change things at a moments notice. I can identify expectations that are too high but somehow try to build a win/lose situation out of most things--and most things are not that black and white.</p>
<p>So today has been quiet.  I learned as a child how to be awake but very, very quiet, and Erin's late sleep today meant that I wasn't about to empty the dishwasher, start some laundry, rush in and out of the house and make Wrigs noisy, or anything else.  I spent a lot of time in worthless internet trolling and finishing up last night's Moo2 game, and I upgraded to the Safari 4 beta while also downloading Chromium (seriously, I have a huge crush on Chrome and can't wait for real the Mac port). I finally realized I was gettign srtuck simply to kep quiet, and that seemed dumb (Erin woke up long enough to say that I could break my silence, but whatever). So I walked to the coffee shop, netbook and library books snug in my messenger bag.</p>
<p>I read some of th Oregonian (especially about a group that works with troubled youth to help them write and produce plays) and checked out a flyer about <a href="http://performanceworksnw.org/">Performance Works NW</a> and felt myself remembering that I want myu profession to be about helping people, that perhaps the arts need a higher place in my life and actions. I started reading my book about Insight Dialogue, and began to remember when my Zen practice was informing my coaching practice and how good and right and not-stressed that felt.</p>
<p>Today has been filled with the Mirah andThermals albums I grabbed on emusic, and full of thoughts and dreams and writing and websurfing and americano drinking</p>
<p>But most importantly, today has been quiet, and I'm so glad this was so.</p>

<p>Postscript:  I think somehow <a href="http://www.2gq.org/easterisland.html">this project</a> figures in to the above realizations.</p>
