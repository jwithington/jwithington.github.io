<article class="post-content">
  <p>In high school I played in Jazz band.</p>

<p>Both jazz bands, if I’m being specific. The typical path was that fresh/soph/juniors played in Jazz Band II, and Jr./Sr. folks played in Jazz Band I. Music was my thing, though, and my director saw that ever since sixth grade, and so he let me play tenor sax 2 in JB 1. As a freshman. </p>

<p>I was terrified.</p>

<p>But I did it. It was a small town, and we had a friendly, dynamic, and championship-winning band director. At that time we also had an amazing tenor 1 player who, you know, also played both ways (linebacker and running back, I believe) for the football team that would go to state that year. Band was somehow slightly cool that year–we even had varisty cheerleaders who marched on Saturdays.</p>

<p>I learned a lot playing with that group. I got a bit cocky, I’m sure, but it was weird to be a freshman in that group, so I also had to just shut up and play. </p>

<p>And I loved it. We would play “Gonna Fly Now” from Rocky when the basketball team took the floor, and at some point we’d play “25 or 6 to 4,” and I can remember the dufus who played baritone sax (“What the hell is that? I want one!”) that year just wailing on the notes as they went lower and lower.</p>

<p>When you’re a band nerd, a joiner, and someone who just wants to play more and more, you do what I did–play for both jazz bands. One year I played first chair baritone in one band and Tenor 1 in the other. I dabbled in trombone for a bit. I’m too old to be bragging about this–it’s just what I did, part of that life as much as pb &amp; j and working on homework.</p>

<p>As I got older, I also got to play solos. Often. Turns out that if you actually like to play and aren’t terrible at it, it’s actually a better experience of <em>playing</em> when you’re indoors, for a basketball game, than outside at a football game. It’s part of what made jazz band awesome.</p>

<p>And I learned by doing. We’d get to those amazing breaks in the music–the ones marked “16: tenor 1 solo” or sometimes even just “16: solo”–my director would point to me, and off I went. I learned a bit about blues scales, sure, but I’ve always been someone who played by ear, and that meant improv as trial and error. I got better and better at it. I got to shove my bell around a microphone once in a while and wail. I’m not sure if anyone but maybe the parents at the basketball games cared. But for me, it was so much. So much.</p>

<p>I’m thinking about JB I and II tonight because after a trip to [Jazz Record Mart][jrm] I realized that, duh, more baritone sax should be in my life. And so I sit in a Starbucks and I fire up Spotify and I pick out that [Pepper-Knepper][pep] album that the JRM had and it runs for a while and then I think about <em>playing</em> baritone sax and I think, “what were some of those songs that we played? Did we play something called ‘I Remember Clifford?’”</p>

<p>Yes, yes we did. </p>

<p>So for the last 45 minutes or so I’ve listened versions of that song one after another after another, cold air coming in from the coffeeshop door, my shoulders hunched as I type on my little netbook running [CrunchBang][cbn] and picturing Mr. Tirk and the band room and all of it. And I remember the night I lost my temper and drove to the game and played the solo of my life. And I remember playing a miked solo at Soldier Field a full half-step off and, for once in my young life, laughing off such a potentially terrible mistake (it was <em>cold</em>, and the fan reaction was <em>funny</em>. There was throwing of beer.). </p>

<p>At this point in my life, I’ve often told the stories about how listening to Bell Biv Devoe and Def Leppard and Nirvana helped me survive. </p>

<p>I need to remember that so did <em>playing</em> music. <em>Making</em> something. Those jazz standards played by kids with no knowledge of the history of the songs, led by a guy who, well, had that knowledge. A guy who grew up in New York and went to Birdland and somehow settled in a small northern Illinois town. I always say I was lucky to grow up in a small town. Jazz band is one reason why. </p>
