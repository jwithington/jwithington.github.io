<article class="post-content">
  <p><img src="/images/nest-on-books-on-shelf.jpg" alt="A nest on top of a stack of books, on a bookshelf" /></p>

<p>For the first 5 weeks or so of 2017, <a href="https://github.com/jwithington/100-days-of-healthing/graphs/commit-activity">I committed a whole lot</a> to my #<a href="https://github.com/jwithington/100-days-of-healthing">100DaysOfHealthing repo</a>. The project buzzed around my head, I set up my work computer to launch Git Bash every day when I logged in, and <a href="http://selfcare.tech/">folks that I admire</a> even added me to their <a href="https://github.com/jenniferlynparsons/selfcaretech/pull/36">own projects</a>.</p>

<p>And then hey look at that, it was February, and a lot of good things were happening in my personal life‚Äìhealth things shaking out, finances slowly but kinda surely improving, meditating every day (not just three minutes at a time, but 10 minutes, even! Thanks <a href="https://www.headspace.com">Headspace</a> !), and going to acupuncture regularly. I took baths a lot more with the help of the ‚Äúpodcast bath kit‚Äù my girlfriend bought me for Christmas. I helped promote self-care at work and at home. I had encouraging things for other folks who were participating.</p>

<p>And then, the commits dried up.</p>

<p>I feel a responsibility to explain that, and also like the idea of showing how <em>this kind of shift</em> can be positive, too.  So here goes.</p>

<h2 id="you-are-not-your-projects">You are not your projects</h2>

<p>You know what would suck? If <strong><em>trying to get one self-care hour a day stressed you the fuck out</em></strong>. If trying to make time to track a self-care hour <em>in itself made you miss or long for self-care</em>. If ‚Äúupdate self-care log‚Äù because a niggling, nagging task, instead of a joyous way to track amazing steps!</p>

<p>Did this happen to me? No way. But as I started updating three, four, seven days all in a batch, I realized something:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It was more important to me to live a life that included self-care (and promotion of self-care) than it was to do little updates every day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cop out? Hmm.</p>

<p><code>¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø</code></p>

<p>But here‚Äôs a list of things that have happened since my last commit to the repo:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For my birthday, my girlfriend, dog, and <strong>I took a screenless weekend on the Washington coast</strong>. This included a lot of taking baths, reading, and not much else. I wanted a pause, and I got one, and it was like a self-care boot camp reset.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I learned that <strong>I no longer wanted to use my phone as my alarm</strong>. Weird? I dunno, but hear me out: screenless weekend meant my phone wasn‚Äôt the last thing I saw at light‚Äôs out or the first thing I saw when waking up. I no longer could get sucked in to distractions at the time when my mind is most apt (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MpRt41tPoc">apt!</a>) to fill with distraction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>So I bought a [Pebble Time][pebble]. This, too, was huge. Now I had an alarm that would wake me up silently, more easily, and without  HEY HERE‚ÄôS ALL THE COOL PHONE THINGS YOU CAN DO staring at me from moment one. I can walk the dog without my phone as a step tracker. I have a thing that lives on my body that maybe is a bit less accurate but more realistic in telling me when I was <em>actually</em> sleeping.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I continued working out some medication stuff that‚Äôs important.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I had some mini-breakthroughs in therapy and at acupuncture.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These seem positive to me. And (maybe with the exception of a gadget, even a well-thought out one) it seems like ongoing self-care, too.</p>

<h2 id="unstructured-time">Unstructured Time</h2>
<p>I never take any. If I think of the kind of thing where I actively just‚Ä¶hang out? Watch a random movie? Read a magazine and just drink coffee, or even just go out for coffee without a Task At Hand? I hardly ever do these things.</p>

<p>And my therapist (who rules) and I keep coming back to that. I always feel <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/251">time-constrained</a>, and I also always feel like ‚Äúthis time right here has to have something going on.‚Äù</p>

<p>So, in a way, I‚Äôve been doing more self-care during #100DaysOfHealthing. I just haven‚Äôt always planned, executed and recorded it.</p>

<p>I hope that‚Äôs true for you as well.</p>

<p>And I know that I have a loooong way to go improve my relationship with myself and others, but the self-care part has landed in a good spot.</p>

<h2 id="now-what">Now What?</h2>

<p>Well, a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I still consider the project to be underway, for me, and for any of you that are still doing it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the future, for the project, I‚Äôm going to consider finding a way to make tracking days a lot simpler / more ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù. Because stressing out about tracking self-care is super unproductive.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At some point we will reach 100 days!  And then maybe, later in the year, I‚Äôll do a relaunch of the project.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>But for now, know this: I‚Äôm supporting myself by taking time for self-care. I hope you are, too.</p>

<p>p.s. I wrote this about two weeks ago, but didn‚Äôt quite post it then. I think it all still stands though. üòÄ Today, March 18, is Day 75, if you‚Äôre counting.</p>
