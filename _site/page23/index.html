<p>I was first introduced to largehearted boy because some smart ass made a tracker that listed how often he posted about the Mountain Goats (short answer: often).  So, it comes as no surprise that he would have<a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2008/02/sam_means_inter.html"> a great interview on the site</a> with Mr. Darnielle, the day <em>Heretic Pride</em> comes out.  I had to avoid reading all of it because I want to have a mostly unsullied-by-reviews reaction to it, but I surely will come back to it later.  A favorite part:</p>
<p><em><strong>SM: "In the Craters on the Moon" talks about "the end of a long war," but it's not a political song...</strong></em></p>
<p><em>JD: THANK YOU SAM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY INTERVIEWERS THINK THIS IS A POLITICAL SONG BECAUSE IT HAS THE WORD "WAR" IN IT. I love everybody but seriously people a signpost doesn't always indicate a road.</em></p>

<p>So, for a while now I've been referring to my "Big Three" of favorite bands:  The Hold Steady, The Mountain Goats, and Wilco.</p>
<p>I think it's safe to say I narrowed it down to one.</p>
<p>Darnielle and the boys had <strong>so much fun</strong>.</p>
<p>It should go without saying that we did, too.</p>
<p>Sleep now.  More later.</p>

        <p class="post-summary">
          
            According to a recent Seattle Weekly article, in November Google VP Sukhinder Singh Cassidy "predicted that by the year 2015, a storage device the size of an iPod will be able to hold 4 terabytes. In seven years, every song ever recorded in the world will fit in our pockets."

Now, this doesn't say "and that will totally be an affordable device for the typical consumer," but then again, it's also possible that we're going to be all Shadowrun-ned up with chips in our head. For perspective, keep in mind that blogs as a phenomenon (rather than just a sort of niche market) didn't exist seven years ago.

The article goes on to talk about a few things, such as:

--having a ton of choice leads to being dissatisfied (sort of a grass is greener approach -- if you could torrent a new yard)

--this glut will lead to a transition from actively choosing to just picking from what's readily available, and

--this leads to an over-reliance on filters (top 40 lists, trusted music sites, social network sites) to give leads on what to choose (or pick).

The writer even astutely notes, "I now find myself getting bored, even in the middle of songs, because I can."

What's really intriguing for me, though, is this idea that too much choice still means too much.
