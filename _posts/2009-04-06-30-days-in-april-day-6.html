<p>I'm really enjoying the guerilla style of all of this. I'm finding myself creating as I used to--phrases from my journals, photos I made ages ago yet recontextualized, office productivity programs used for art-making.</p>
<p>I'm feeling unstuck. I'm on to something here.</p>

<p>One last thing:  MAN Apple rules at making things easy to use.</p>
