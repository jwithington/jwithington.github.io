<p>I decided to show you the kind of writing that pours out of me when I let my words go.  This also means that I wrote more today, hooray!</p>
<p>However, I couldn't get this image post to show up properly in the blog post itself, so I gave you a tease above.Â </p>
<p>To read it properly, please <a href="http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=3443255399&#038;size=large">click to view, full size, with a black background</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Thanks for clicking.</p>
