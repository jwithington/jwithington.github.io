<p>We had a party on day three.  Well, it was taco night.  Essentially a party, yes?</p>
<p>And parties can be art right?  I'm going to write five reasons why this works, and have that qualify as the day three project, okay? Okay.</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ethernautrix/3031043716/">The Act of Drinking Beer With Friends is the Highest Form of Art</a>.<br />
2. Like any performance, you have to prepare, know your audience, and essentially design sound, lighting, and even your "character" for the night.<br />
3. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_art">Performance art is art in which the actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.</a><br />
4. I am thinking of how creating something daily is an act of creating meaningful experiences.  This was a great one! <br />
5.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happening">Happenings</a>. 'Nuff said.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the people who helped create this project for Day 3!  :-)</p>
