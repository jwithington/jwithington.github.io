<p>Music as<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unbelievableÂ <br />
busting bursting at the seams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirsting catching dreams</p>
<p>I can just write and write and write but I never know if it really is what I really want it to be<br />
Seeming to me like<br />
bad poetry</p>
<p>"It's the process," he used to say with a laugh.</p>
<p>It's the process.</p>
