<p>Working with digital loops to create music is a really odd form of creativity. Odd because it feels a bit like cheating, and a bit like MAN THIS IS SO AWESOME I MADE A SONG.</p>
<p>Anyway, enjoy some more <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/garageband/">Garageband</a> tuneage.  I might do something odd involving weird <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/">Keynote</a> presentations next. </p>
<p>Yes, seriously.</p>
