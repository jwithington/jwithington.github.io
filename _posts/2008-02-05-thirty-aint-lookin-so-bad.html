<p>I lost my weird misplaced integrity by downloading the new Mountain Goats album.  I tried to not listen to it until I could listen to it all in one sitting but that's really hard shit to do, yknow?  Really hard shit.   And now I am getting sick and I'm not gonna lie: if I have to take sick days it's gonna be all about me, an asthma inhaler, and Heretic Pride over and over and over.</p>

<p>It makes me really happy to know that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bridges-Spirit-Adam-Voith/dp/0967870305">Adam Voith</a> is responsible for <a href="http://www.billions.com/artists/mountaingoats/index.html">booking</a> the Mountain Goats.</p>
