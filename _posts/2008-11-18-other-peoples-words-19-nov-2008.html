<p>I am now a collaborator at <a href="http://nothingextra.wordpress.com/">Nothing Extra</a>. It''s fun!</p>

<p>If you were home, sick, with <a href="http://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=229&amp;Itemid=677">Iron &amp; Wine on PBS</a>, snuggling with your<span style="text-decoration:line-through;"> girlfriend and dog</span> family, and all the memories of places and times you've heard this <a href="http://nothingextra.wordpress.com/2008/10/07/iron-wine-the-creek-drank-the-cradle/">hushed</a>, beautiful music come rushing back, reminding you of the placeds you've been and why you were happy to be the place you are--even if you were sick? Well, I'd be surprised if you, too, didn't cry a little.</p>
<p>I found an <a href="http://http//www.austinkleon.com/2008/08/28/iron-and-wine-austin-city-limits-taping/">excellent drawing post</a> about that night, too.Â  I should have asked if I could use it for this post.</p>
