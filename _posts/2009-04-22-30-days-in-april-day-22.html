<p><strong>Foot (2009)</strong></p>
<p>Ask five friends to measure their feet.</p>
<p>Pick the person who has a foot closest to twelve inches in length.</p>
<p>Take a photo of that person's foot.</p>
<p>Print the photo to actual size.</p>
<p>Hang it on a wall where you live, with the caption "Standard of Measurement" below it.</p>
