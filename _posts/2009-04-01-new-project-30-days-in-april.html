<p>Hey folks!</p>
<p>I've gotten more and more interested in using this space for writing about things other than music, in posting online more, and in sharing creative work that I create myself.</p>
<p>In the spirit of such things, <a href="http://hardlikealgebra.tumblr.com/">I started a tumblr site</a> a few months back, but that wasn't enough. </p>
<p>At this point, I'm going to take HLA in more of a generalist direction.  Separating the arts too much has never suited me, really. I still really want this name to be something that I only use for the highest quality stuff I can do--or at least, the posts with the most thought behind them.  I want to write about the things in culture that strike me, and I also want to post things that I make.  I can use my livejournal, my personal twitter, or my tumblr for the rest.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Now, an announcement is in order:</p>
<p><strong>I am starting a new project this April</strong><strong>, and I'm calling it <em>30 Days in April</em></strong>.</p>
<p>During this month, I'll be posting something, daily, that I've created.  I'm tired of looking back on the seven (seven!) years since I went to art school, or the months since I started renting art space, and wondering why I haven't been creating.  I'm so crazy about changing this ingrained, habitual pattern that I've gotten a <a href="http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?y=0&amp;isbn=1582975299&amp;x=0">daily writing prompts book</a> and even, dare I say it, <em><a href="http://powells.com/biblio/1-9781585421466-9">The Artist's Way</a></em>. </p>
<p>I have been stagnant too long, and so has Hard Like Algebra. This changes today.</p>
<p>I want to thank ya'll in advance for the support. It should be fun.</p>
