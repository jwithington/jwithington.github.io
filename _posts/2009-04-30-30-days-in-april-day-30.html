<p>For the thirtieth day of my project, I was tossing around a few ideas, but nothing really felt right until Erin sarted suggesting a list of 30...somethings.  She was suggesting funny things, kind of as a joke, but I liked this idea.  A lot of the work that's important to me influences the work that I am doing, and I like spreading the word about folks because some stuff is just freaking cool.  For me, it's never about being a snob or knowing more than other people, it's about sharing the art that really gets to me.  The <a href="http://fascinated.fm/">dude who runs Hype Machine</a> describes himself with ths bio: "I wake up in the morning to get people excited about music." Would that we could all be so lucky. Anyway, I give you (with links when I have time to add them):</p>

<p>There are more!  There have to be more. If you know me well, you probably know people that I would have wanted to include better than I do!  These are the ones that came to mind with the assistance of just a few books and references.  There's so much more out there, and I didn't include Eddie, Ben, Nicole, or any of the other artists that I actualy know in real life, in my life.  Feel free to leave comments with great artists that I left out.  </p>
<p>Thanks for coming along this journey with me. I plan that there will be more to come around here. </p>
