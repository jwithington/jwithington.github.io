<p>Work and life are interesting lately, though I should point out that I've been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturdays_%3D_Youth">listening</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_and_Animals">heavily</a> to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hold_on_Now%2C_Youngster...">few</a> <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/matmos/supremeballoon">albums</a>.</p>
<p>It also amuses me to no end that <a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">David Allen</a> keeps popping up on my <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/jwithington">last.fm artist list</a>.  God bless audiobooks.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's a quick post that will hopefully spawn some discussion.</p>
<p>I've been thinking a lot about the most recent Iron &amp; Wine album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSHEPHERDS-DOG-IRON-WINE%2Fdp%2FB000U7161K%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dmusic%26qid%3D1211259540%26sr%3D8-6&amp;tag=harlikalg-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">the Shepherd's Dog</a>, for two reasons, really:</p>
<ol>
<li>Erin likes it, which means that she picks it when it is her record player turn; this has made me pay attention to it more, and</li>
<li>I've been wondering why it was just sort of overlooked by me since I bought it. Why didn't I check this one out much?</li>
</ol>
<p>At any rate, today I realized that the song that she likes most (as she would say, Her Jam) and the one that (so far) I enjoy hearing most couldn't be more different as far old Iron &amp; Wine's formula goes.  I then figured, what's better than asking the internet something?</p>
<p>NOTHING.</p>
<p>So here you go!  Let's compare these two tracks, and discuss a)which one you like better and b)why.  Hate 'em both?  Mention that, too!  In a future post I'll talk about my own take on differing tastes here.</p>
<p>Exhibit A:  White Tooth Man</p>
<p>[audio:WhiteToothMan.mp3]</p>
<p>Exhibit B: Resurrection Fern</p>
<p>[audio:ResurrectionFern.mp3]</p>
<p>P. S. I&amp;W's record label mispelled the album as "the Shepard's Dog" on the downloadable-cuz-I-got-vinyl tracks.  Funny, that.</p>
