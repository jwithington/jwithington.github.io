title: Writing Again, finally
excerpt: I had used my 39th and 40th years to run up an unmanageable amount of credit card debt. <p>Again.</p>

It's truly a [long time coming][hla], but I'm writing again! How 'bout that?

(This post started in a paper journal and here is where I wrote, "Maybe this is a blog post?")

If this *is* a blog post, I'd have to say:

- Moving meant that I don't get to just walk down the street and write at [my favorite brewpub][well80] anymore. Bummer.
- But also, life came at me fast with this move, and maybe I'm finally settled?
- I've truly <u>missed</u> writing, something I can tell even more, now, as I'm doing it again.
- I've decided to sign up for [HiFi][hifi] to help this side of things out; it's been too long since I learned about tender discipline and all the rest. 

I'm excited to be back. ðŸ˜€
