<p>I'm trying to enter the world of CSS tweaking in order to make this place look a bit less boring than before.</p>
<p>A big thanks to Erin for putting up with me getting stuck on the desk for a few hours.</p>
<p>No love to the desk, though.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you know stuff about wordpress layouts, or have a good place to go to pick some up, let me know in the comments.<br />
I might keep this theme for a while, or I might decide that I am annoyed and try another.</p>
