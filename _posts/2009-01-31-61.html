<p>While this post admittedly exists a <em>tiny</em> bit to ensure that I have posted <em>something</em> at least monthly, I also haven't yet had a time to write a post gushing about The Tallest Man on Earth, and he totally deserves the gushing.</p>
<p>So, go check out <a href="http://www.myspace.com/thetallestmanonearth">his Myspace page</a>.  You'll get past the Dylan comparison fairly quickly, and then you'll be rushing out to go get the <a href="http://www.insound.com/search/query/The+Tallest+Man+on+Earth/">fancy-pants limited edition vinyl album</a>.  Trust me, you'll be glad you did.</p>
