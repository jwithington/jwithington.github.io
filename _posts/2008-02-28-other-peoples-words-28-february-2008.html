<p><a href="http://www.onesevensevensix.com/amplive/index.html">Radiohead remixes</a> for free (and it's legal!).  [<a href="http://17dots.com/2008/02/15/more-free-radiohead/">via</a>]</p>

<p>I was first introduced to largehearted boy because some smart ass made a tracker that listed how often he posted about the Mountain Goats (short answer: often).  So, it comes as no surprise that he would have<a href="http://www.largeheartedboy.com/blog/archive/2008/02/sam_means_inter.html"> a great interview on the site</a> with Mr. Darnielle, the day <em>Heretic Pride</em> comes out.  I had to avoid reading all of it because I want to have a mostly unsullied-by-reviews reaction to it, but I surely will come back to it later.  A favorite part:</p>
<p><em><strong>SM: "In the Craters on the Moon" talks about "the end of a long war," but it's not a political song...</strong></em></p>
<p><em>JD: THANK YOU SAM DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY INTERVIEWERS THINK THIS IS A POLITICAL SONG BECAUSE IT HAS THE WORD "WAR" IN IT. I love everybody but seriously people a signpost doesn't always indicate a road.</em></p>

<p>Rosemary posted about the free Mobius Band <a href="http://www.mobiusband.com/vday/index.html">covers album</a>, and proved that you can <a href="http://softspoken.warmsilence.org/?p=69">capture the personal meaning of a song</a> in far fewer words than I usually do.</p>
