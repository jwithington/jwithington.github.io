<p><a href="http://hardlikealgebra.com/category/30-days-in-april/">Thirty days</a> is still happening!</p>
<p>It is happening as a <a href="http://tinyletter.com">tinyletter</a>, and as a <a href="http://pdxrockpoet.tumblr.com/">rock poet</a>, and in other places as well. <a id="fnref:1" class="footnote" title="see footnote" href="1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Neither am I.</p>
