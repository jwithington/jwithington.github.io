<p><strong>Mail Reaction (2009)</strong></p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>1.  Choose and listen to one of the unmarked songs below.<br />
2.  If you know the song, then choose another.<br />
3.  If you do not know the song, then listen to the song in its entirety.<br />
4.  During or after listening, make a piece of postcard-sized art based on what you are hearing.  This can include anything you define as art.<br />
5.  Send the postcard/art to:  Hard Like Algebra, PO Box 40161, Portland, OR 97240-0161. Be sure to identify if it was track 1, 2, 3, or 4.</p>
<p>Bonus:  any participant who choses to do so may include the link to a song in the comments.  Upon receipt of that participant's art, I will participate in the first 4 steps above, and send my art to the participant's address.</p>
<p>One last thing:  some of the embedded info in the tracks is showing through on two of these.  Please ignore those words--the songs are intended to be heard without band or track name.</p>
