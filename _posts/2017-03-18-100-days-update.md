## What I‚Äôve been doing; or, what if you start a project and it kinda takes off but doesn‚Äôt; or, what if it seems like you abandoned your own thing; or, integrating new practices; or, Day 36 to Day 64

For the first 5 weeks or so of 2017, [I committed a whole lot][commits] to my #[100DaysOfHealthing repo][repo]. The project buzzed around my head, I set up my work computer to launch Git Bash every day when I logged in, and [folks that I admire][selftech] even added me to their [own projects][selftech-pull-request].

And then hey look at that, it was February, and a lot of good things were happening in my personal life--health things shaking out, finances slowly but kinda surely improving, meditating every day (not just three minutes at a time, but 10 minutes, even! Thanks [Headspace][headspace] !), and going to acupuncture regularly. I took baths a lot more with the help of the "podcast bath kit" my girlfriend bought me for Christmas. I helped promote self-care at work and at home. I had encouraging things for other folks who were participating.

And then, the commits dried up.

I feel a responsibility to explain that, and also like the idea of showing how *this kind of shift* can be positive, too.  So here goes.

## You are not your projects

You know what would suck? If ***trying to get one self-care hour a day stressed you the fuck out***. If trying to make time to track a self-care hour *in itself made you miss or long for self-care*. If "update self-care log" because a niggling, nagging task, instead of a joyous way to track amazing steps!

Did this happen to me? No way. But as I started updating three, four, seven days all in a batch, I realized something:

> It was more important to me to live a life that included self-care (and promotion of self-care) than it was to do little updates every day.

Cop out? Hmm.

 `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

But here's a list of things that have happened since my last commit to the repo:

- For my birthday, my girlfriend, dog, and **I took a screenless weekend on the Washington coast**. This included a lot of taking baths, reading, and not much else. I wanted a pause, and I got one, and it was like a self-care boot camp reset.[^1]

- I learned that **I no longer wanted to use my phone as my alarm**. Weird? I dunno, but hear me out: screenless weekend meant my phone wasn't the last thing I saw at light's out or the first thing I saw when waking up. I no longer could get sucked in to distractions at the time when my mind is most apt ([apt!][apt]) to fill with distraction.

- So I bought a [Pebble Time][pebble]. This, too, was huge. Now I had an alarm that would wake me up silently, more easily, and without  HEY HERE'S ALL THE COOL PHONE THINGS YOU CAN DO staring at me from moment one. I can walk the dog without my phone as a step tracker. I have a thing that lives on my body that maybe is a bit less accurate but more realistic in telling me when I was *actually* sleeping.

- I continued working out some medication stuff that's important.

- I had some mini-breakthroughs in therapy and at acupuncture.

These seem positive to me. And (maybe with the exception of a gadget, even a well-thought out one) it seems like ongoing self-care, too.

## Unstructured Time
I never take any. If I think of the kind of thing where I actively just...hang out? Watch a random movie? Read a magazine and just drink coffee, or even just go out for coffee without a Task At Hand? I hardly ever do these things.

And my therapist (who rules) and I keep coming back to that. I always feel [time-constrained][b2w], and I also always feel like "this time right here has to have something going on."

So, in a way, I've been doing more self-care during #100DaysOfHealthing. I just haven't always planned, executed and recorded it.

I hope that's true for you as well.

And I know that I have a loooong way to go improve my relationship with myself and others, but the self-care part has landed in a good spot.

## Now What?

Well, a few things:

- I still consider the project to be underway, for me, and for any of you that are still doing it.

- In the future, for the project, I'm going to consider finding a way to make tracking days a lot simpler / more "on the fly". Because stressing out about tracking self-care is super unproductive.

- At some point we will reach 100 days!  And then maybe, later in the year, I'll do a relaunch of the project.

But for now, know this: I'm supporting myself by taking time for self-care. I hope you are, too.

p.s. I wrote this about two weeks ago, but didn't quite post it then. I think it all still stands though. üòÄ Today, March 18, is Day 75, if you're counting.
