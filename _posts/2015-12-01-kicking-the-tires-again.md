title: Kicking the Tires, Again
---

And here I am, [kicking the tires]({% post_url 2014-01-16-kicking-the-tires %}) on a new way to blog. I like that this is fully Githubbed out, and is helping me blow the dust off my git knowledge. I like the thought of using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [hosting it for free][githubhostfree] too, to be honest. 

It's not necessarily the right time for me to be doing any sort of side- side- project, but hey: if I start writing again, I'll be glad I did it.

There are still some things probably leftover here and there from the [theme's site](pixlly.com), but I'm sure I will clean those up in time. I'm working on fixing some images, too.
