title: I Remember Clifford
---

In high school I played in Jazz band.

Both jazz bands, if I’m being specific. The typical path was that fresh/soph/juniors played in Jazz Band II, and Jr./Sr. folks played in Jazz Band I. Music was my thing, though, and my director saw that ever since sixth grade, and so he let me play tenor sax 2 in JB 1. As a freshman. 

I was terrified.

But I did it. It was a small town, and we had a friendly, dynamic, and championship-winning band director. At that time we also had an amazing tenor 1 player who, you know, also played both ways (linebacker and running back, I believe) for the football team that would go to state that year. Band was somehow slightly cool that year--we even had varisty cheerleaders who marched on Saturdays.

I learned a lot playing with that group. I got a bit cocky, I’m sure, but it was weird to be a freshman in that group, so I also had to just shut up and play. 

And I loved it. We would play “Gonna Fly Now” from Rocky when the basketball team took the floor, and at some point we’d play “25 or 6 to 4,” and I can remember the dufus who played baritone sax ("What the hell is that? I want one!") that year just wailing on the notes as they went lower and lower.

When you’re a band nerd, a joiner, and someone who just wants to play more and more, you do what I did--play for both jazz bands. One year I played first chair baritone in one band and Tenor 1 in the other. I dabbled in trombone for a bit. I'm too old to be bragging about this--it's just what I did, part of that life as much as pb & j and working on homework.

As I got older, I also got to play solos. Often. Turns out that if you actually like to play and aren’t terrible at it, it’s actually a better experience of *playing* when you’re indoors, for a basketball game, than outside at a football game. It's part of what made jazz band awesome.

And I learned by doing. We’d get to those amazing breaks in the music--the ones marked “16: tenor 1 solo” or sometimes even just “16: solo”--my director would point to me, and off I went. I learned a bit about blues scales, sure, but I’ve always been someone who played by ear, and that meant improv as trial and error. I got better and better at it. I got to shove my bell around a microphone once in a while and wail. I’m not sure if anyone but maybe the parents at the basketball games cared. But for me, it was so much. So much.

I’m thinking about JB I and II tonight because after a trip to [Jazz Record Mart][jrm] I realized that, duh, more baritone sax should be in my life. And so I sit in a Starbucks and I fire up Spotify and I pick out that [Pepper-Knepper][pep] album that the JRM had and it runs for a while and then I think about *playing* baritone sax and I think, “what were some of those songs that we played? Did we play something called ‘I Remember Clifford?’”

Yes, yes we did. 

So for the last 45 minutes or so I’ve listened versions of that song one after another after another, cold air coming in from the coffeeshop door, my shoulders hunched as I type on my little netbook running [CrunchBang][cbn] and picturing Mr. Tirk and the band room and all of it. And I remember the night I lost my temper and drove to the game and played the solo of my life. And I remember playing a miked solo at Soldier Field a full half-step off and, for once in my young life, laughing off such a potentially terrible mistake (it was *cold*, and the fan reaction was *funny*. There was throwing of beer.). 

At this point in my life, I've often told the stories about how listening to Bell Biv Devoe and Def Leppard and Nirvana helped me survive. 

I need to remember that so did *playing* music. *Making* something. Those jazz standards played by kids with no knowledge of the history of the songs, led by a guy who, well, had that knowledge. A guy who grew up in New York and went to Birdland and somehow settled in a small northern Illinois town. I always say I was lucky to grow up in a small town. Jazz band is one reason why.
