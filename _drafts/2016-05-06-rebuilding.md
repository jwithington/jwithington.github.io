excerpt: Labs, Jekyll, and "something technology"
---

The new job has a thing called "labs" where we can work on "something technology" every Friday. It just has to be somewhat tech-related. This past Saturday was [JekyllConf][conf], so I figured it only made sense to work on something in Jekyll before the conference began.

I considered just doinking around in Jekyll with a template site, or building something as a prototype just to see what I could do.  Then I realized something that had actually been bothering me for a while was a project I could tackle.
