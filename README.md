Hard Like Algebra has been a thing since January 2008.  I guess I probably started it when [The Mercury](http://portlandmercury.com) decided to not run my year end list and to instead cut me from the music staff.

This is the first time I've used Github for a blog, though. I'm using Pixyll for the theme right now, and a ~~bunch of luck~~ new skills for the code. Hope you enjoy it!
